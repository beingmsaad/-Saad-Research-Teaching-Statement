\begin{newlfm}

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor at \depart at \univ, as advertised online by the \depart. I have read the university philosophy and mission statement which motivated to apply for the position. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at University of Central Florida, and I expect to graduate in May 2021. At UCF, I am a member of Security Analytics Lab (SEAL), advised by Professor David Mohaisen. 

At SEAL, I conduct research on the security of distributed systems, particularly the blockchain attack surface. More recently, my research is focused on exposing the gap between theoretical models of blockchain systems and their real world implementation which leads to partitioning attacks. I have also worked on projects related to social network analytics, provenance in audit applications, and mobile application security using the trusted execution environment. Alongside research, I have also engaged in the teaching activities by serving as a teaching assistant for Foundations of Computer Security and Privacy, and Natural Language Processing. As a teaching assistant, I acquired preliminary training in course management, effective communication, and student coaching. My research and teaching experience will complement the job requirements of an assistant professor. 

At \univ, I will also be taking part in co-curricular activities related to student management, department programs, academic contributions, and diversity initiatives. At UCF, I have volunteered as an instructor for Camp Connect program to teach high school kids. I also helped organizing CoNEXT 2019, organized by my advisor, Professor Mohaisen. As part of my contribution to the academic community, I have served as a reviewer for twelve conferences and journals. I can leverage all these experiences to contribute towards research, teaching, co-curricular initiatives at \univ. 




Attached with this letter are my curriculum vitae, teaching statement, and research statement, demonstrating my qualifications for the job and academic achievements. During my Ph.D., I have published thirteen peer-reviewed papers in top-tier conferences and high-impact journals, including the first systematic survey of the blockchain attack surface and two best paper awards. Currently, I have multiple collaboration in academia and industry which will be useful for sponsorship and new research initiatives. I believe that the outstanding research community at \univ~will provide excellent opportunities to start my teaching and research career. Please contact me for any questions, and thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
