In times of globalization and internationalization, understating diversity is important than ever.  
As a multicultural family, my wife and I lived and studied in three different countries; China, South Korea, and the United States. For this reason, we faced various difficulties and barriers as minorities in each and everyone of those countries. Thanks to this experience, I recognize those barriers which minorities can face in pursuing higher education. I believe that the key to diversity is equal opportunity, and I will strive to ensure equal opportunity to all students.  

After attending N2Women Panel Discussion and Mentoring Session\footnote{Co-located in ACM CoNEXT 2019; where I was the volunteer, assisting my PhD advisor, who was the co-organizer)}, I learned widely about the gender imbalance in academia and the difficulties females facing to become part of the relevant research communities, in most areas of computer science, as well as approaches to reduce such imbalance through active recruitment, which I have experienced first-hand, having been part of two large groups in the US and South Korea.

As a PhD student, fortunately, I have been working with enlightened advisors during my graduate studies who take diversity very seriously and as a priority. Like my role models, Prof. DaeHun Nyang (Inha University) and Prof. Aziz Mohaisen (University of Central Florida) who always provide an equal chance to talented students without considering gender, age, nationality, race, and religion, I would like to embrace such principles towards diversity. In Prof Nyang's lab, I worked with talented colleagues  from different backgrounds, gender, age, race, and socioeconomic (ranged from 20s to 40s, and from countries such as Uzbekistan, Finland, China, and Palestine (Middle East), students included males and females, etc.) 

As a PhD student in Prof. Mohaisen's lab at UCF, I had the honor to guide a female undergrad student (African American) in a research intern program sponsored by NSF. During advising, Prof. Mohaisen actively tried to understand the difficulties of the student when pursuing higher education (as a student who had to work multiple jobs while studying) and help by providing funding opportunities to her. This experience allowed me to understand that circumstances for minority students might be the severest, and various hardships, including financial, have to be tackled for them to participate in higher education. 

My experience in working with diverse students is not limited to this mentorship experience, but includes working with a large number of students from various backgrounds, as proven by my coauthored research papers. Thanks to Prof. Mohaisen, I have been working in a diverse environment, where our laboratory member consists of American (various races), Turk, Indian, Pakistanis, Korean, Palestinian, and Saudi Arabian; with different religions. In this dynamic and rich work environment, I had the chance to learn about different cultures, religious, and backgrounds, where the mutual respect has been a key element.
These instances of experience have not only helped me understand the importance of diversity in academia but inspired me to think about how to make a social contribution in different aspects and how to be a great teacher and advisor, embracing diversity as an element.

Combing my personal experience, as my advisers have been doing, I will continuously follow their footsteps and tackle difficulties and barriers that may hinder females and other underrepresented minorities in engaging with the higher education process and research. Moreover,  I will actively provide equal opportunities for them to succeed in their academic journey and to enrich the academic process by bringing all talents on board.
