\title{Teaching Statement -- \name{Muhammad Saad }}
\thispagestyle{empty}
Teaching is an integral part of academia and it plays a critical role in shaping our future. In the applied field of computer science, teaching requires effective knowledge communication, practical skill development, and inspirational mentorship.  Constructive teaching is a powerful learning experience, both for teachers and students. My key motivation to join academia is to leverage the teaching opportunities and impart skills, values, and experience to young minds and enable them to fully harness their potential and creative pursuits.  


\subsection*{Teaching Philosophy and Style}
My core teaching philosophy pivots on the principle of {\em effective learning}, which requires acknowledging teaching as a sanctimonious profession rather than an occupation. I believe that {\em effective learning} is a multi-variate approach towards minimizing the gap between knowledge to be imparted and the understanding of students. In the following, I briefly explain the key constructs of {\em effective learning}.

The most important aspect in knowledge communication is the classroom environment. From experience, I have learned that the most productive classroom environment is an interactive environment which promotes collaborative education. Since each student has a unique aptitude and personality, therefore, a classroom is a diverse environment with unique challenges. An interactive environment ensures that (1) students gain confidence to express their thoughts to the instructor and colleagues, (2) an instructor is comfortable to engage with each student and help them where needed, (3) problem solving and learning are collective and mutual, and (4) an innate sense of responsible teamwork develops among students regarding their coursework and projects. To enable such an interactive environment, there are useful methodologies that can be adopted including (1) getting to know students and addressing them by their names and preferred pronouns, (2) promoting group activities and presentations, (3) encouraging peer feedback, and (4) adopting a friendly classroom environment. Therefore, the foundation of my teaching philosophy is in a healthy, productive, and interactive classroom environment. 

The second key component of {\em effective learning} is the ability to utilize available resources in order to maximize the knowledge communication. This has become a major challenge especially after COVID-19 when we had to adapt remote learning and online lectures. From my experience, I have realized that a good teaching style involves a good mix of using multimedia tools such as PowerPoint presentations, classroom board for problem solving, and handouts before and after the lecture. 

includes the ability to reduce the gap between the knowledge to be imparted and the understanding of the students. 


1) translate knowledge
2) Get feedback
3) Improve
4) Learn from students


I consider a teacher as a service/content provider for the undergrad student and role model for graduate students. This thinking is coming from my personal experience of close to a decade of study as both undergrad and graduate students. As a teacher to undergraduate students, I will consider myself a content provider who provides useful content to customers (students). Feedback about the content will be essential in improving quality. Of course, it is impossible to cover all angles of knowledge in a single course, thus determining what is essential based on the current trend in both academia and industry is essential, namely, in designing undergraduate material, I am to answer: 1) why is it important? 2) where it is/can be used, and 3) is it state-of-the-art knowledge? Instead of boring teaching and practice, I will focus on answering these three questions before going through every point to achieve the active learning of students. To this end, I firmly believe that delivering knowledge is important. Yet, more important is to teach students to understand the value of knowledge and methods to learn efficiently. As an advisor of graduate students, I will strive to be a good role model for my students. To be a good advisor, I will lead by example by showing my effort and passion in research by conducting in-depth research and publishing significant papers myself, and in the process teach my students principles of research. I believe the most important thing to show is my ability in research, demonstrating both quality and ethics.

\subsection*{Teaching Experiences}
Over the past five years, I had had various opportunities to practice my teaching philosophy. During my graduate studies, I had the unique experience of being a teaching assistant for multiple courses, such as algorithms, computer security, and coding competition (the equivalent of ICPC). In the coding competition course, my responsibilities were to define the algorithms problems (with the lecturer), provide test cases (input/output datasets), and sample solutions. My primary routine was to maintain the code evaluation servers for hundreds of students (4 parallels classes). At that time, I had a chance to look into most codes, which helped me understand in-depth  1) which part of knowledge students usually cannot understand well, 2) which part of coding skills students lacked, and 3) what kind of mistakes students made. Based on this experience, I provided feedback to students for guiding them to improve their coding skills. This process not only helped me understand the challenges in teaching but also allowed me to think more about the way of delivering knowledge. As a graduate student, I was also the lead mentor of three master's students during my Ph.D. (and under the guidance of my advisor). I had an opportunity to experience guiding students to conduct research and experiments scientifically. Even though delivering advanced knowledge and training material was challenging, it was a rewarding experience possible only through persistence. This unique training also provided me with the skills required to succeed as a mentor: when under the pressure of work, one may overlook the health of the environment in which students work. To ensure a healthy work environment, I always had time allocated to hear from my mentees about their concerns with their studies outside of the lab. Needless to say, having that little time allocated to understand students better had the most significant impact on their productivity. In the future, I will keep that as a principle in my teaching and mentorship. 

\BfPara{Teaching Interest} While I will be capable of teaching most introductory computer science courses, I will also be capable of teaching courses such as algorithms, computer systems (operating systems, networked systems), and computer security, both graduate and undergraduate.
