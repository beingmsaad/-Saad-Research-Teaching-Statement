I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor at \depart at \univ, as advertised online by the \depart. I have read the university philosophy and mission statement which motivated to apply for the position. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at University of Central Florida, and I expect to graduate in May 2021. At UCF, I am a member of Security Analytics Lab (SEAL), advised by Professor David Mohaisen. 

At SEAL, I conduct research on the security of distributed systems, particularly the blockchain attack surface. More recently, my research is focused on exposing the gap between theoretical models of blockchain systems and their real world implementation which leads to partitioning attacks. Besides blockchains, I have also worked on projects including security of social networks, provenance in audit applications, mobile system security using the trusted execution environment. Along with the research, I have also engaged in the teaching activities by serving as a teaching assistant for Foundations of Computer Security and Privacy, and Natural Language Processing. 




As you will see in my curriculum vitae, teaching statement and research statement, I have a proven record of achievements and qualifications including having two Ph.D. degrees, a long list of training, and publishing in top-tier conferences and high-impact journals, which will allow me to make major contributions to the university. I would appreciate considering me for the position of assistant professor at the. Please, feel free to contact me if any information is needed. I look forward to hearing and meeting with you.
